# User Authentication and Profile Management
This project serves as a comprehensive starter template for building a full-stack web application featuring user authentication, profile management, and seamless form validation. The technology stack encompasses Node.js, React, Formik, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. The backend architecture relies on Node.js and Express, while the frontend user interface is meticulously crafted using React, elegantly styled through Tailwind CSS. Vite, renowned for its swiftness, empowers the development process.

## Key Features
User Authentication: Effortless user registration and login powered by JWT token-based authentication.
Profile Management: Streamlined profile management, allowing users to access and update their details.
Form Validation: Enhanced user experience facilitated by Formik for advanced form validation.
Responsive Design: Impeccable and intuitive UI across a variety of devices courtesy of Tailwind CSS.
Private Routes: Restricted access to authenticated users through secure private routes.
